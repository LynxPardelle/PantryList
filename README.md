# PantryList
An app that helps me check the recurring home products that I need to buy, in order to have all the things schedule for me to go to the grosery store every n days, weeks or months.

It's important to create an auto-schedule based on how much of the thing the user have and how many did the used has been used in the past for every day, week, month or year.

Example 1: title: Some product, quant: 1lt, use: 2lt per month. autoSchedule: next buy on 2 weeks.

Example 2: title: Some other product, quant: 500g, use 1kg per 2 weeks. autoSchedule: next buy on 1 week

We need to use DAO's and factory pattern in order to change from the persistence to a database in order to be able to see this app on every device the user needs.

The color palette, should be cheerful and warm, like home.
